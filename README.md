### Hi there 👋
### My name is Kacper/Casper AKA Puffercat and I am a programming beginner.

<!--
**KZacharski/KZacharski** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my website and FeverOS Custom rom
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NuxtJS, NGINX and Custom ROM development
- 💬 Ask me about VSCode
- 📫 How to reach me: @puffercatt on Twitter or @puffercat on Telegram
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: In 7th grade I was making our Scratch assignments in JavaScript instead. Also I'm ace 🏳️‍🌈. Not so fun fact, I used the default gh README template with really minor changes. New, better readme coming soon.
